Build a Pomodoro Clock

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR/.

User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.

User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.

User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

FROM WIKIPEDIA::
There are six steps in the technique:

Decide on the task to be done.
Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).[1]
Work on the task until the timer rings. If a distraction pops into your head, write it down, but immediately get back on task.
After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.[7]
If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 1.
After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
